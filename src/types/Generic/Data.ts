/**
 * This type represents a set of values (stored in an array) along with an
 * `isSingular` flag indicating whether the set is "conceptually singular"
 * (i.e., will always have a cardinality of 0 or 1). For example, "The latest
 * post" is conceptually singular, but "Posts by John Doe" isn't, even though
 * both could happen to be have only 0 or 1 items.
 *
 * This type is basically an instance of the Writer monad. The computed data is
 * the main data array (which is the List monad), while the isSingular metadata
 * constitutes the monoid. Its mzero is true and `mappend` is defined as &&.
 *
 * This type is very convenient for repersenting values that go in JSON:API's
 * `data` key, whether as primary data or in a relationship. Such values are
 * rendered differently in JSON:API when they're conceptually singular -- namely,
 * the empty set gets rendered as null rather than [], and a single item set is
 * rendered as list[0] rather than as an array -- but we don't want to have to
 * care about that final rendering as we're working with the values. This type
 * gives us a map/flatMap that doesn't need to think about cardinality, while
 * then letting us output the value appropriately with the unwrap() method.
 *
 * The name of this type, though arguably a little too generic, was chosen as
 * a reference to JSON:API's use of the key `data` and because it's short.
 *
 * Note: because this is just the list + writer monad, its polymorphic in all T.
 * However, in practice, we mostly use it for resources and resource identifier
 * objects (which are all JSON:API `data` can hold). Still, the polymorphism
 * comes in very handy. For example, Mongoose also returns (null | doc) when
 * the result is conceptually singular (i.e., findOne queries), but a doc[] when
 * it's conceptually plural, and the polymorphism lets us use Data for that too.
 * Also, we might convert the items in a Data to plain JS objects in prepration
 * for output, again leveraging the nice uniform map/bind interface.
 *
 * The one complication is that we need our mapping/binding functions to be
 * able to return promises if we're going to implement beforeRender/beforeSave
 * transforms on top of this abstraction, which is the point. That creates a
 * problem, though, because we have to await the promise inside this abstraction,
 * as the abstraction needs to see the final values to do the join (as part of
 * flatMap), etc. One option was to make the internal data always be a promise,
 * which would've been "purer" because we could've continued to follow all the
 * monad laws with no extra functions/rough edges, but it would've lead to
 * allocating a ton of unnecessary promises throughout the codebase, since this
 * is used everywhere. So, instead, I made separate promise-aware mapAsync and
 * flatMapAsnyc functions that know how to await the transformed results and
 * return a promise for a new Data<T>.
 *
 * TODO: Make this a subclass of array, maybe leveraging Symbol.species?
 * That would give us reduce/every/forEach etc for free...
