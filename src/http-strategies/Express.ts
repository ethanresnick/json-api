/**
 * This controller receives requests directly from express and sends responses
 * directly through it, but it converts incoming requests to, and generates
 * responses, from Request and Response objects that are defined by this
 * framework in a way that's not particular to express. This controller thereby
 * acts as a translation-layer between express and the rest of this json-api
 * framework.
 *
 * @param {Object} options A set of configuration options.
 *
 * @param {boolean} options.tunnel Whether to turn on PATCH tunneling. See:
 *    http://jsonapi.org/recommendations/#patchless-clients
 *
 * @param {string} options.host The host that the API is served from, as you'd
 *    find in the HTTP Host header. This value should be provided for security,
 *    as the value in the Host header can be set to something arbitrary by the
 *    client. If you trust the Host header value, though, and don't provide this
 *    option, the value in the Header will be used.
 *
 * @param {boolean} options.handleContentNegotiation If the JSON API library
 *    can't produce a representation for the response that the client can
 *    `Accept`, should it return 406 or should it hand the request back to
 *    Express (i.e. call next()) so that subsequent handlers can attempt to
 *    find an alternate representation? By default, it does the former. But you
 *    can set this option to false to have this code just pass on to Express.
